# A Written Report on the Analysis 

## Overview of the Analysis

For the project we had access to about 50 datasets. These datasets each contained reviews of specific products that amazon offers. Using PySpark, we perform ETL and loan the data into pgAdmin. Then we used Pandas and PySprak to come up with obervations. 

# Results:

* Vine Review

We can see from the image above that 51.06 % of reviews where 5 star vibe reviews. The remaining 38 percent where unpaid non-vine reviews. 

# Summary
The conclusion we draw from this database is that there are 51% five-star reviews in the Vine Program on Amazon. We can see that this is a positive bias for the Vine program.
Another way to support out conclusion would be to take mean, median and standard deviation into considerations so that we could see what the distribution looks like.
